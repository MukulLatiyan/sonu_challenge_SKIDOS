# sonu_challenge_SKIDOS
SKIDOS assignment for SSE(Golang)

## Part A 
My solution to Part A is present inside the partOne directory. It contains a .go file and an executable. You can run the executable and pass in
the user input you desire and it will print the output in MilliSeconds.

## Part B
My solution to Part B is present inside the partTwo directory. It contains a .go file and an executable. I used goroutines and a channel in that
code. Feel free to enter the user input and test the code, the output will in MilliSeconds.

## About Testing
I created a single test application that is present inside the test/ directory, feel free to relocate to it and when inside you just need to run
```
go test -v 
```
and it will test the Part A case.
